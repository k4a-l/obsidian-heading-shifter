Easily Shift and Change markdown headings.

## Why use this plugin

Obsidian links numerous markdown files to form knowledge. Daily rearrangement of links is important to create a good knowledge base.

The following situations often occur in this process.

1. Cut out A part of File 1 to an independent File 2 and linked.
    - Heading3 in file 1 is changed to Heading1 in file 2
2. Incorporated the content of File 3 into a part of File 4
    - Heading2 in file 3 is changed to Heading4 in file 4

With this plugin, you can change the Heading size (the number of `#`) in a batch instead of changing it manually.

## How to install

### From within Obsidian

- Open Settings > Community plugin

| Style to remove(Other arbitrary group of regular expressions) | If this style is at the <position> of a line, remove it                                        | string[]([])      |
| Auto Outdent                                                  | When heading is applied to a list, if outdent is needed for lists after that line, execute it. | true, Shift+Tab   |

#### Style to remove

This is the toggle between removing or retaining `specific style` when applying Heading in a "single" row.

##### Beginning

`-` or `1.`,`2.`,`n.` or `user defined string(RegExp)`

|                    | Before    | After(True) | After(False) |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| `- `(ul)           | `- line`  | `## line`   | `## - line`  |
| `1. `(ol)          | `1. line` | `## line`   | `## 1. line` |
| `ðŸ¤”`(user defined) | `ðŸ¤”line`  | `## line`   | `## ðŸ¤”line`  |

##### Surrounding

`**`, `_` , etc... or `user defined string(RegExp)`

|                    | Before     | After(True) | After(False)  |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `**`(bold)         | `**line**` | `## line`   | `## **line**` |
| `_`(italic)        | `_line_`   | `## line`   | `## _line_`   |
| `ðŸ¤”`(user defined) | `ðŸ¤”lineðŸ¤”` | `## line`   | `## ðŸ¤”lineðŸ¤”` |

### Auto Outdent

```markdown
- heading target
    - other listA
        - other listB
```

If you call 'Apply Heading 2',

#### Auto Outdent = False

```markdown
## heading target

    -   other listA
        -   other listB
```

Subsequent listings will remain in depth and will not have the correct markdown structure.

#### Auto Outdent = True

```markdown
## heading target

- other listA
    - other listB
```

Subsequent listings will be outdent and have the correct markdown structure.

â€»Two editor histories will be created to invoke the two processes of â€œapply heading -> outdent. Therefore, undo is required twice.

## Use Case

Operate headings like an outliner like the following,

```markdown
# The Festival Myster -> hit "Apply 1"

This is a great document.

## Chapter One -> hit "Insert deeper"

### Prologue -> hit "Insert deeper"

The sun was setting over the horizon...

### The Summer Festival -> hit "Insert current"

As the townspeople gathered in the town square...

## Chapter Two -> hit "Insert higher"

### The Mystery of the Missing Prize -> hit "Insert deeper"

As the summer festival came to a close...
```

If you want to make headings deeper or higher than 2, use "shift" or "apply".
